# Cisco Scrapper

Tool to archive your CISCO course.

# Configuration

Configure `netacad-config.js` with your email and password, the `course_button_url` must be configured with the URL of the page where it should have a button that says `Load `**course name**` in a new window`, as seen in the screenshot bellow:

[load course page](./IMG/0.png)


The course_url should be the page that opens when you click the example above, in my case:
