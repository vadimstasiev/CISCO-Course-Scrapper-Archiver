This is the first of three courses that are aligned to the CCNA Certification Exam. ITN contains 17 modules, each with a series of topics. </p><p>In Introduction to Networks, you will gain a basic understanding of the way networks operate. You will learn about network components and their functions, as well as how a network is structured, and the architectures used to create networks, including the internet.</p><p>But ITN is about more than learning networking concepts. By the end of this course, you will be able to build local area networks (LANs), configure basic settings on routers and switches, and implement internet protocol (IP). </p><p>In ITN, every concept that you learn and skill that you develop will be used in the rest of the CCNA curriculum.
